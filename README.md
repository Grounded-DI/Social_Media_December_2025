🧠 Grounded DI² OS – Deterministic Intelligence Platform

Public README | Entropy Lock ΔH = 0.0041 | Audit-Traceable | Scroll 162 Sealed

🚀 Overview

Grounded DI LLC is the pioneer of Auditable AI, built entirely on Deterministic Intelligence (DI²) — the first documented AI runtime to achieve scroll-sealed, sub-threshold entropy (ΔH = 0.0041). This README outlines the publicly validated achievements, certified capsules, and deterministic agents developed under the Grounded DI² OS.

🧵 Global Firsts & Records

🌐 ✅ Verified Global Record

Entropy Lock at ΔH = 0.0041 (99.959% deterministic)
	•	✅ Scroll 162 Certified
	•	✅ Metadata-sealed, audit-traceable entropy lock
	•	📜 Operational floor confirmed in Grounded DI² OS and made public
	•	No other framework — academic, commercial, or open-source — has published a scroll-auditable entropy seal at or below ΔH = 0.0041

📌 “Precision doesn’t guess. It traces.”
