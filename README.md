## Part 1 – Run BriefWise Prompt (14th Amendment)

### Summary Judgment Argument: Fourteenth Amendment Challenge to School Discipline

#### I. **Introduction & Procedural Posture**

> **Procedural posture:**  
> Plaintiff (student, by parents) moves for summary judgment, alleging the school’s suspension violated rights under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. Defendant (public high school) claims the suspension was justified to prevent disruption.

---

#### II. **Legal Standards**

##### A. Due Process in Public Schools

- The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause protects students from arbitrary deprivation of liberty or property by state actors. Suspension from a public school implicates a protected property interest in education and a liberty interest in reputation (*Goss v. Lopez*, 419 U.S. 565, 574 (1975)).
- **Minimum requirements:** Notice of charges and, if the suspension is 10 days or less, “an opportunity to present his side of the story” (*Goss*, at 581).

##### B. Equal Protection in the School Context

- The Equal Protection Clause prohibits states from denying any person the equal protection of the laws (U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1).
- School disciplinary policies must not be enforced in a manner that discriminates on the basis of suspect classifications (e.g., race, viewpoint), and must be rationally related to a legitimate state interest (*Plyler v. Doe*, 457 U.S. 202, 216 (1982)).
- Content- or viewpoint-based restrictions may also implicate First Amendment principles, but under Fourteenth Amendment analysis, the standard is rational basis unless a suspect class or fundamental right is involved.

##### C. Student Speech & Disruption Standard

- Public school students retain constitutional rights, including free speech, but these rights may be curtailed if the expression would “materially and substantially disrupt” school operations (*Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist.*, 393 U.S. 503, 509 (1969)).
- Mere apprehension of disturbance is insufficient; there must be facts which “might reasonably have led school authorities to forecast substantial disruption” (*Tinker*, at 514).

---

#### III. **Application to the Facts**

**Step 1:** Due Process  
- Did the student receive notice and an opportunity to respond? If yes, procedural due process is satisfied (*Goss*, at 581).
- If the suspension was imposed without minimal notice or chance to be heard, this would violate due process.

**Step 2:** Equal Protection  
- Was the disciplinary action enforced evenhandedly, or did the school single out the student based on a protected characteristic (e.g., political viewpoint)?
- If there is evidence the student was punished due to the *content* of the political T-shirt, this may trigger equal protection and possibly viewpoint discrimination concerns (*Tinker*, at 511; *Plyler*, at 216).

**Step 3:** Disruption Standard  
- The school must demonstrate specific facts showing the T-shirt caused or was reasonably forecasted to cause a “material and substantial” disruption.
- Absent such evidence, punishing the student solely for political expression would likely violate constitutional protections (*Tinker*, at 514).

#### IV. **Audit Trail**

| Step | Rule/Standard                         | Logic Applied                                                                                                         | Citation(s)                                  |
| ---- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Due Process Notice/Opportunity        | School must provide notice & hearing before suspension.                                                               | *Goss v. Lopez*, 419 U.S. at 581             |
| 2    | Equal Protection - Non-Discrimination | Action must not target protected class/viewpoint; must be rationally related to state interest.                       | *Plyler v. Doe*, 457 U.S. at 216             |
| 3    | Student Speech & Disruption           | Expression may only be restricted if it would “materially and substantially disrupt” schoolwork/discipline.           | *Tinker v. Des Moines*, 393 U.S. at 509, 514 |
| 4    | Application: Political T-shirt        | If suspension was based on content, and no actual/substantial disruption was present, action likely unconstitutional. | *Tinker*, *Goss*, *Plyler*                   |

---

#### V. **Conclusion**

> **If** the school suspended the student *without* proper notice/opportunity to respond, or *without* evidence of actual or likely substantial disruption—and if discipline was content-based—summary judgment for the student is warranted under the Fourteenth Amendment.  
> If due process was observed and real disruption documented, the school’s action may be upheld.
